# atwork_commander

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/steup/atwork-commander.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/steup/atwork-commander)

Complete reimplementation of a Refery Box (Refbox) for the @Work-League of the RoboCup.

This Refbox is a native ROS application. However it aims to enable multiple communications backends through individual plugins.
Additionally, a RViz GUI will be developed, which provides enhanced visualization capabiliities for referies and visitors / spectators. Generation of tasks conforming to the rule book configurable using the ROS parameter service to be easily adaptable to future changes of the RuleBook.


## HowTo

### Starting the Refbox

1. Start the __core__ and __com__ components: `roslaunch atwork_commander atwork_commander.launch`
2. Generate a task using the CLI: `roslaunch atwork_commander generate.launch task:=<task to generate>`
3. Wait for robots to register
4. Start the task execution using the CLI: `roslaunch atwork_commander start.launch`

For testing the refbox without any robot a fake robot may be used using the **example_robot**:
`roslaunch atwork_commander example_robot.launch`

### Configurations

- All launch files share the __refbox__ parameter to specify the refbox to connect to. Multiple refbox can be started on the same PC using multiple namespaces.
- If more information is wanted the __verbose__ parameter enables more verbose logging.
- If the task shoudl only be send to some registered robots, the robots can be specified in the __start__ command using the robots parameter in the format "<team_name>/<robot_name>"

### Runtime control

- the __forward__ launch file enables manual state change from PREPARATION to EXECUTION:
  `roslaunch atwork_commander forward.launch`
- the __stop__ launch file enables stopping of the currently running task:
  `roslaunch atwork_commander stop.launch`

### Easy to use script

You can use the script "default_bringup" which automates the refbox startup.
Its purpose is mainly for new teams so that they can create bagfiles for tasks more easily.
You can also use it for normal refbox startup, however you will need to kill the nodes afterwards manually..
The cleanup is done automatically if you set the  **_immediate** param to **True**

Use e.g. this command to start the script (replace the task for the one you want):

`rosrun atwork_commander default_bringup _task:=BTT1 _immediate:=True _record_rosbag:=True`

NOTE: This requires rosbash to be installed:
`sudo apt install ros-melodic-rosbash ros-melodic-rosbash-params`

You can also modify the script to use other launchfiles than the default ones provided within this package.
This is especially useful for your own arena configurations and robot descriptions.

## Documentation

Currently in the __docu__ folder. Multiple '.graphml' files showing the design of the architecture and the future GUI (Viewable and editable with e.g. [yEd Graph Editor](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed))

## Sub-Components

The following section will briefly summarize the individual components purpose.
For further information have a look at the respective sub-components README.md.

### core

State-Machine implementation and Pub/Sub and Service implementations to couple all sub-components.

### msg

Contains ROS messages and service descriptions necessary to communicate within
the refbox.

### com

Will contain multiple communication plugins to enable flexible communication
links to various types of robots.

### gui

Aims to enable visualization and control of multiple aspects of a Task before, during and after a run.

### gen

Enable dynamic task generation according to specified task types of the @Work
RuleBook.

## TODOs

- GUI is currently mockup only
- COM only contains multi-master ROS communication plugin
- GEN is not fully RuleBook compatible
